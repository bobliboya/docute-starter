## About the Course

Explore the concepts, methods, and applications of differential and integral calculus, including topics such as parametric, polar, and vector functions, and series. Youâ€™ll perform experiments and investigations and solve problems by applying your knowledge and skills.



## Skills You'll Learn

- Determining expressions and values using mathematical procedures and rules
- Connecting representations
- Justifying reasoning and solutions
- Using correct notation, language, and mathematical conventions to communicate results or solutions

## Equivalency and Prerequisites

### College Course Equivalent

A first-semester college calculus course and the subsequent single-variable calculus course

### Recommended Prerequisites

You should have successfully completed courses in which you studied algebra, geometry, trigonometry, analytic geometry, and elementary functions. In particular, you should understand the properties of linear, polynomial, rational, exponential, logarithmic, trigonometric, inverse trigonometric, and piecewise-defined functions, as well as sequences, series, and polar equations. You should know how to graph these functions and solve equations involving them. You should also be familiar with algebraic transformations, combinations, compositions, and inverses for general functions.



## About the Exam

The AP Calculus BC Exam will test your understanding of the mathematical concepts covered in the course units, as well as your ability to determine the proper formulas and procedures to use to solve problems and communicate your work with the correct notations. A graphing calculator is permitted for parts of the exam. Note: You may not take both AP Calculus AB and Calculus BC Exams within the same year.

### Exam Duration
3hrs 15mins
