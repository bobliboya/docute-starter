# 11.2 Common Resources

## Free-Rider Problem

- If people do not pay for public goods, there is no incentive for private firms to produce public goods.

- Public goods are under produced by the free market. Without the government there would not be enough public goods.

- How does the government decide which public goods to provide?

## Common Resources

- Water
- Air
- Public Land
- Sunshine
- Oceans

&emsp;&emsp;Because nobody owns common resources, like the oceans, they are overused and eventually destroyed.

&emsp;&emsp;Everyone can pollute or catch fish, or hurt whales as much as they want.
