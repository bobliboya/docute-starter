# 10.4 Tax or Regulation

## Taxes or Regulation

&emsp;&emsp;Taxes and regulation are different ways to internalize the externality.

&emsp;&emsp;Taxes provides an incentive to continuing reducing pollution as much as possible.

## 2 Ways the Gov't can Fix the Externalities

### ① Command + Control (Also called Regulations)

​	Examples: Toxic Gasses and Nuclear Waste

​	The cost of ragulating a pollution is too high.

### ② Corrective Taxes ("Pigoovian Taxes")

​	Tax are better than regulation for a few reasons:

- Taxes provide an incentive to reduce pollution as much as possible
- Tex Revenue for Government (Regulation increases the costs for the government)



*Firms that want to continue polluting will pay taxes.<br/>Firms that don't want pay taxes will reduce pollutions.*



## Tradeable Pollution Permits

- Like a coupon, or a certificate, or a ticket
- If you have a pollution permit, you are allowed to pollute a certain amount<br/>*(1 permit might equal 1 ton of pollution)*
