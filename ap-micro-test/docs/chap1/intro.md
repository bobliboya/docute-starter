# Introduction of Economics

## Difference between MICRO and MACRO Economics

**MICRO economics**<br/>Study of small economic units such as individuals, firms and industries.

 

**MACRO economics**<br/>Study of the large economy as a whole or economic aggregates(经济总量).

## What is ECONOMICS?

Economics is the science of **scarcity** (=value—we have unlimited wants but limited resources).

## Ten Principles of Economics

1. People face **trade-offs**.

2. The cost of something is what you give up to get it.

3. **Rational** people think at the margin.

4. People respond to incentives.

5. Trade can make everyone better off.

6. Markets are usually a good way to organize economic activity.

7. Governments can sometimes improve market outcomes.

8. A country's standard of living depends on its ability to produce goods and services.

9. Prices rise when government prints too much money.

10. Society faces a short-run trade-off between inflation and unemployment.

 

**Trade-offs**<br/>All the alternatives that we give up when we make a choice.

 

**Opportunity Cost**<br/>What you give up to get something else.

 

 

**Rational**<br/>You will make a choice benefits you.<br/>Making a decision based on benefit > cost.<br/>People act in their own self interest.

 

**Incentives**<br/>A reason, or motivation to do something.

 

**Markets**<br/>Group of buyers and sellers.

## Five Key Economic Assumptions

1. Society has unlimited wants and limited resources (scarcity).

2. Due to scarcity, choices must be made. Every choice has a cost (a trade-off/opportunity cost).

3. Everyone responds to incentives and acts in their own “self-interest”.

4. Everyone makes decisions by comparing the marginal costs and marginal benefits of every choice.

5. Real-life situations can be explained and analyzed through simplified models and graphs.

## Key Terms

1. **Investment**<br/>The money spent by BUSSINESS to improve their production.

 

2. **Consumer Goods**<br/>Created for direct consumption (ex: pizza)

 

3. **Capital Goods**<br/>Created for indirect consumption (ex: oven烤箱, knives, etc.)<br/>=Goods used to make consumer goods 

 

4. **Human** **Capital**<br/>Any skills or knowledge gained by a worker through education an experience.

## The Factors of Production

1. Land
2. Labor   
3. Capital
4. Entrepreneurs

## Every Society Must Answer Three Questions

1. What goods and services should be produced?

2. How should these goods and services be produced?

3. Who consumes these goods and services?<br/>→The way these questions are answered determines the economic system.<br/>→**Free Market (Capitalist) Economy**<br/>Decisions made by buyers and sellers.<br/>=buyers and sellers determine resource allocation(分配)


 

**Command (Centrally Planned) Economy**<br/>Decisions made by government.

 

**Mixed Economics**<br/>A system with free markets but also some government intervention.
