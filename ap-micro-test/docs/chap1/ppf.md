## Points on the Curve

**Point A, B and C – Efficient,** we are using all available resources.<br/>**Point D – Inefficient/Unemployment,** we are not using all available resources.<br/>**Point E – Impossible/Unattainable,** we do not have enough resources.

## Opportunity Cost on the Curve

**Opportunity Cost –** The **slope** of the PPF curve.<br/>If the Opportunity Cost is **constant**, the curve is a **straight line**;<br/>If the Opportunity Cost is **increasing**, the curve is **bowed out**.

**Reasons of PPF Shifting**

1. Technology advance

2. Increase of total resources

 

**Capital Goods(资本品)**<br/>Capital goods are used for production by firms. They can used to produce profit by firms. Example: Tools, Basic Materials, Powers, etc.
