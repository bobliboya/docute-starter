|           | **Pineapples** | **Radios** |
| --------- | -------------- | ---------- |
| **Kenya** | 30 (1P=1/3R)   | 10 (1R=3P) |
| **India** | 40 (1P=1R)     | 40 (1R=1P) |

 

Trading **1 radio for 2 pineapples** will benefit both.

If Kenya produces radios by themselves, they give up 3 Pineapples for each radio. If they can trade 2 pineapples for each radio they are better off.

If India produces pineapples by themselves, they give up I pineapple for one radio. If they can get 2 pineapples for one radio they are better off.
