# 标点符号

## 逗号

Comma: a punctuation mark, that is especially used as a mark of separation within a sentence.<br/>
从定义中不难看出，逗号的主要作用是分割，通过聚集或者分割单词、词组和从句，帮我们准确地理解句子意思。


1)使用逗号分割并列列举的项<br/>
Eg：In order to survive in the wildness, she needs water, food, and other essential items.<br/>

2)使用逗号分割整句前的词组 <br/>
Eg: Travelling in Beijing，I have to take my bag pack.<br/>

3) 使用逗号分割主句和从句<br/>
Eg: Even though it appears a great idea, I still have to think it over.<br/>

4) 使用逗号分割插入语和主句成分<br/>
Eg：The Great Wall, one of the greatest places of interest in China, attracts millions of tourists every year.



## 分号

semicolon: a punctuation mark ; used chiefly in a coordinating function between major sentence elements (as independent clauses of a compound sentence)也就是说，分号主要是在句子间起连接作用的。(而逗号是不可以连接两个完整的句子的)<br/>

1)用分号表达比句号短比逗号长的停顿<br/>
Eg: Functionalism in language teaching was taken by many to mean the complete exclusion of any focus on form in the classroom; grammar and the explicit teaching of rules simply had no place.<br/>

2)用分号连接两个主从句或者并列句<br/>
Eg: The news may be unexpected; nevertheless it is true.<br/>

3)在句子中如果已经使用过逗点，为了避免歧义的产生，就用分号来分隔相似的内容 -------(超级逗号)<br/>
Eg: The employees were Tom Hanks, the manager; Jim White, the engineer; and Dr. Jack Lee.<br/>

Eg:We visited Pago Pago,Western Samoa;Curitiba,Brazil;and St. George, Utah.（ 我们访问了西萨摩亚的帕果-帕果、巴西的库里提巴和犹他州的圣·乔治。



## 冒号

colon: a punctuation mark;used chiefly to direct attention to matter (as a list, explanation, quotation, or amplification) that follows.引出下文的解释说明或者要引用的内容

1) 解释说明或者举例<br/>
