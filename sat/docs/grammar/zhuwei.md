# 主谓一致

1.逻辑一致

2.数量一致



## 考点1：特殊成分作主语

### ①and 短语作主语

&emsp;&emsp;Amy and her friends are going to the shopping mall.

### ②附加短语

&emsp;&emsp;如along with... ,in addition to...., as well as..., together with.. .附加短语放在主语之后做修饰语成分，所以不影响主语的数量。

&emsp;&emsp;Amy, as well as her friends, is going to the shopping mall.

&emsp;&emsp;Jack, together with his wife, has gone to Japan.

### ③Or, either..or, neither..nor 做主语

&emsp;&emsp;谓语动词采用就近原则

&emsp;&emsp;Neither Amy nor her friends are going to the shopping mall

&emsp;&emsp;Neither students nor the teacher is going to the feld trip.


### ④集合名词作主语(分五类)



### ⑤ Indefinite Pronouns作主语

&emsp;&emsp;anyone, anybody, anything, everyone, everybody, everything等不定代词作主语，谓语通常用单数形式。 

### ⑥ Quantity Words and Phrases作主语

&emsp;&emsp;数量名词题请件主语，如The number of...短语作主语，谓话动词用单数形式，而 a number of ...短语作主语时，谓语动词用复数形式。

### ⑦专有名词

&emsp;&emsp;以-s后缀的学科名词如mathematics, politics,economics; 以-s后缀的活动名词如aerobics；以-s后缀的疾病名词如diabetes， arthritis, bronchitis 都属于单数名词。



## 考点2：主谓分割 隔山打牛

&emsp;&emsp;判断主谓一致的关键就是成功找到主语和谓语， 不论是在主句还是从句中，考查频率比高的一个点是**主谓之间被各种成分分隔**，以增加考查的难度。

### ②分词短语迷惑

The region bounded by the northwest corner of Greenland, the northern tip of Labrador, and the Mackenzie Delta **includes** the islands collectively known as the Canadian Arctic Archipelago. 

### ③同位语迷惑

### ④定语从句迷惑

The Andes Mountain chain, which includes some of the Western hemisphere's highest peaks,  **is** a much more formidable barrier.
